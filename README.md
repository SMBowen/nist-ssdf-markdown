# NIST Secure Software Development Framework

This is a version of the [NIST SSDF](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf) but in Markdown,
this is just so if you want to copy it into your own company Wiki for whatever reason,
you can just copy the markdown here, and paste it into your wiki.

This could be useful, if you wanted to make links to particular sections, which is hard to do in a PDF.
